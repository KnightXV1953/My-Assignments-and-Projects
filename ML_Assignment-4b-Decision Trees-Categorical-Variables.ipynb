    "###### *Course Instructors: Dr. Hassan Raza, Mr. Ahmad Raza*\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this part of assigment is to implement a Decision Tree Classifier for categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** Please note that you are allowed to use only those libraries which we have discussed in the class, i.e. numpy, scipy, pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "You are required to submit the original notebook file on the google classroom (with .ipynb extension), with complete set of outputs. Students failing to do so will get zero marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read each step carefully and understand it fully before proceeding with code writing*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plagiarism\n",
    "Any form of plagiarism will not be tolerated and result in 0 marks.\n",

    "### Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in this assignment we will be implementing the Decision Classifier for both Continuous and Categorical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree can be built by using any of the following split criterias, namely:\n",
    " - Information Gain\n",
    " - Gini Index\n",
    " - CART \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you are required here to implement the decision tree with information gain as splitting criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember in my code i am not looking for maximizing the information gain, instead i am looking for minimizing the split entropy. Recall,\n",
    "$$Information Gain  = H(D) - H(D_Y,D_N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "\n",
    "$H(D)$ is the data set entroy and $H(D_Y,D_N)$ is split entropy. Since $H(D)$ is constant for the given dataset so maximizing the entropy is equal to minimizing the split entropy and that is what is being represented in my code outputs."
