    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this assigment is to implement a Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** Please note that you are allowed to use only those libraries which we have discussed in the class, i.e. numpy, scipy, pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "You are required to submit the original notebook file on the google classroom (with .ipynb extension), with complete set of outputs. Students failing to do so will get zero marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Please read each step carefully and understand it fully before proceeding with code writing*\n",
